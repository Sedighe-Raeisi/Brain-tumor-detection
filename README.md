# Brain Tumor Detection

In this project I used a dataset of brain MRI images. This dataset contained two classes, one class belongs to images which are healthy brains. The other class belongs to images of brains with tumor.  
I dowloaded the dataset from link bellow:

The class of healthy brains contained 154 images.   
The class of images with tumor contained 155 images.

I used a CNN neural network to make a binary classifier.
